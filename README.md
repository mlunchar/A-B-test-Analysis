# A-B-test-Analysis
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course to maser A/B test analysis.
* In this project, we've chosen between ICE and RICE frameworks to use one of them for hypotheses prioritization to help the marketing department.
* For A/B test analysis we've made several calculations by group: cumulative revenue, cumulative average order size, relative difference in cumulative average order size, conversion rate, number of orders per user, and order prices. Additionally, we've used Mann-Whitney test for several hypotheses testing.
* For data visualization we've used Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

Project description: 
As an analyst in a big online store, we're going to prioritize hypotheses we've come up together with the marketing department to boost the revenue. Then we're going to launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

Project structure:

1. General information and data preparation. We're going to take a look at the data we have, check whether it has no errors and prepare it for analysis.
2. Prioritizing Hypotheses. We're going to choose one of the nine hypotheses on boosting an online store's revenue.
3. A/B Test Analysis. We're going to analyse the results we've got after launching an A/B test.
4. We'll present the overall conclusion and advice for business.


Additionally:

* The project was made in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

* When downloaded, the data has to be stored in the same folder with the notebook.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in January 2022.
